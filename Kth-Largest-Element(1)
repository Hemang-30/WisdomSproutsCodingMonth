   Challenge: Find Kth largest element in a given array.
   (this is the easiest approach to this problem assuming all elements are unique,
   and we have the inbuilt sort function available at our disposal)
   (I will post another solution without using the inbuilt functions for sorting, and also
   taking care of identical elements)
